Good job, you have finished the tutorial!

## Conclusion

By now you should know that Dhall is a programmable configuration language, akin to JSON with types and functions.
It is used as a **single source of truth**, to generate data for other configuration files and anywhere else it may be used.
It also has tools that lets us generate Dhall from other configuration languages, which can be used for retroactive typing and comparisons.
In general, Dhall makes it easier and safer to create configurations, as well as manage them.
A nice addition to your DevOps toolbox!
